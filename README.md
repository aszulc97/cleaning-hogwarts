# Cleaning Hogwarts Data

This is an small exercise that is an introduction to a bigger assignment - [Hacked Hogwart](https://github.com/aszulc97/hacked-hogwart).

My tasks were to: 
- split the data into parts: first name, middle name, nickname and last name,
- remove unnecessary whitespaces,
- fix the capitalization - each part of name or house name should have first letter in uppercase and the rest in lowercase.
- show a right image for each student (that required thinking about some exeptions)
